##Game Description
**Working Title: CSE360 Rally**

Race your friends across the country from LA to New York City!

The race is divided up into multiple stages. The winner of every stage gets a number of points based on the distance of the stage he/she has won. The rest of the players will get a percentage of the points awarded to first place, which will depend on their finishing place.

LA to Phoenix – 100 steps – winner gets 100 points  
Phoenix to Albuquerque – 100 steps – winner gets 100 points  
Albuquerque to Denver – 125 steps – winner gets 125 points  
Denver to Lincoln, Nebraska –125 steps – winner gets 125 points  
Lincoln, Nebraska to Chicago – 150 steps – winner gets 150 points  
Chicago to DC – 175 steps – winner gets 175 points  
DC to NYC – 100 steps – winner gets 200 points

At the end of each stage and before the next stage begins, players with enough points will have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicle allowing them to move at a faster rate.

Upgrade Options include:  
-Race tires  
-Hi-flow exhaust  
-Racing suspension  
-Turbos  

If a player has a stock vehicle, he/she will move at the face value of the dice roll (ie roll a 5, move 5 steps).
Depending on the combination of upgrades, the player will move at the face value plus an extra number of steps.

If a player lands on a pot-hole he/she moves back a certain number of steps.
If a player lands on "get pulled over by the cops" he/she will get skipped on their next turn.
If a player lands on “race fuel” they will move an extra number of steps.
